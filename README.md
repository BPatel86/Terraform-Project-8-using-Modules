# Terraform-Project-8-using-Modules

## Overview
This Terraform project demonstrates how to use **modules** to organize and reuse your infrastructure code. Modules help break down complex configurations into smaller, manageable, and reusable components.

## Whatâ€™s inside
- A root configuration that calls one or more modules.
- Modules that define specific resources (e.g., EC2 instances, security groups).
- Variables and outputs to parameterize and share data between modules.

## Why use modules?
- **Reusability:** Write code once, use it multiple times.
- **Organization:** Keep your project clean and maintainable.
- **Scalability:** Easily manage complex infrastructure setups.
